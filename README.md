# E-Portfolio-specialties-of-cpp
This is the repository for my e-Portfolio for software engineering course 2021/2022. The topic of this presentation were the specialities of the programming C++, especially Templates and Metaprogramming which is extensively used in the Standard Template Library (STL).

## Prerequisites
No other prerequisites than an internet connection are needed in order to follow this e-portfolio. While exploring the functionalities of the C++ templates we will use compiler explorer [godbolt](https://godbolt.org/). Godbolt is a web-based compiler and code explorer for C/C++, which allows us to write, compile and run C or C++ code. The main feature, however is the ability to investigate the corresponding assembler code for each line of C++ code in the browser. We will use this feature to understand the characteristics of C++ templates as simple as possible.

## Getting started
Each of the following code snippets can be compiled, investigated and executed in the browser by simply pasting the source into the code segment. All demo code snippets can be found in the [demo](/Demo/) folder.
